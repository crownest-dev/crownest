# @crownest/mcp

`@crownest/mcp` is a stdio MCP server that lets MCP hosts use CrowNest Sandboxes as tools. It wraps the TypeScript SDK, creates Sandboxes on demand, runs Commands and Python code, manages Workspace files under `/workspace`, creates and downloads Artifacts, manages Previews, inspects Code Contexts, and exposes safe API-key and Project operations for agents.

The package is published as `@crownest/mcp`. Once maintainers publish a registry release, MCP hosts can run it with `npx @crownest/mcp`.

The hosted CrowNest service and runtime implementation are not part of this package.

## Host Configuration

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add crownest -e CROWNEST_API_KEY=cn_live_... -- npx @crownest/mcp
```

Generic MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crownest": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@crownest/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CROWNEST_API_KEY": "cn_live_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set `CROWNEST_API_URL` only when targeting a non-production CrowNest API.

## Sandbox Lifecycle

The server sends MCP startup instructions that describe `/workspace`, the lazy default Sandbox model, Code Run output promotion, usage discovery, Sandbox TTL semantics, retry/idempotency routing, and cleanup.

It lazily creates one default Sandbox on the first stateful tool call. Tools that operate inside a Sandbox return `sandbox_id`, and later calls can pass that `sandbox_id` to keep using the same Workspace. `create_sandbox` creates additional Sandboxes for the same server session, and `kill_sandbox` removes a server-created Sandbox. When stdio closes, the server best-effort kills Sandboxes it created.

`CROWNEST_API_KEY` is a host-process credential for the SDK. It is not passed into Sandbox runtime environment variables.
